# Python
I think the best introduction to Python for our purpose (Handing data, and analysing data) is by compared it with Excel.

1. Handling large datasets in Excel is slower than Python.
2. Excel template is more difficult to reproduce than Python.
3. Excel is not free and has no access to huge opensource library that Python has.
4. Data analysis in Excel is more like mannual drag and drop rather than automated like Python.

Highly encourage all of you to learn Python, especially [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a data analysis package. You would learn enough to read codes in my repository within weeks (Yes. My codes are not rocket science. I did not use any genius magic LOL).

# Installation of Python
1. Download [Anaconda distribution of python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), OR

# How to Run Python File in Terminal
1. search anaconda in Window's start menu
2. type "cd direction/you/saved/the/program", e.g. cd "C:\Users\UserName\OneDrive - Mott MacDonald\Documents\summarizeOutstanding_3RS"
3. type python fileName

# Useful Resources to Learn Python
* [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/)
  This is the main book I read when I started learning Python.
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  A good website to probably save you some time
